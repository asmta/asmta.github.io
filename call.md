Methods of analytical and stochastic modelling are widely used in
engineering to assess and design various complex systems, like
computer and communication networks, and manufacturing systems. The
ASMTA conference is a main forum for advancing these techniques and
their applications and aims to bring together researchers of academia
and industry to discuss the latest developments in analytical,
numerical and simulation algorithms for stochastic systems.

This year, the conference will be held as a workshop within
[IFIP WG 7.3 Performance 2026](https://performance2026.github.io) in Ghent, Belgium.

**Scope and Topics**

ASMTA 2026 seeks both methodological papers that propose novel
analytical and numerical solution techniques for stochastic systems,
as well as application-oriented papers that apply stochastic
modelling techniques to practical performance problems. Topics of interest include
the following.

- (Computationally Intensive) Statistical Methods
- Stochastic Control, Decision Processes and Optimisation
- Rare Events and Stochastic Simulation
- Approximations, Bounds and Limits of Stochastic Models
- Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Dynamic Resource Allocation
- Fluid and Diffusion Limits
- Random Graphs

*Envisaged Application Areas:*
- Complex Systems
- Computer and Information Systems
- Workflow Management Systems
- Communication Systems and Networks
- Wireless and Mobile Systems and Networks
- Peer-to-Peer Applications and Services
- Embedded Systems and Sensor Networks
- Storage Systems, Data Centres, Content Delivery, Cloud/Fog/Edge
