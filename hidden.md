Methods of analytical and stochastic modelling are widely used in
engineering to assess and design various complex systems, like
computer and communication networks, and manufacturing systems. The
ASMTA conference is a main forum for advancing these techniques and
their applications and aims to bring together researchers of academia
and industry to discuss the latest developments in analytical,
numerical and simulation algorithms for stochastic systems.
